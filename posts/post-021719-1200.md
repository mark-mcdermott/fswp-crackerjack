The calc() function in CSS is a great way to do math for your CSS values.  calc(100% - 20px) would determine 100% of the element property and then subtract 20px  If the element dimension the 100% is on is variable, the result of the calc() function will change as the browser window changes.  Calc() works in all major browsers.
