On Linux, to remove all files and directories in a folder, including hidden ones, use `rm -r * .*`  rm is for remove.  The -r flag is for recursive so it will delete folders. The first asterisk means delete all files and directories in the current folder.  The .* means delete any files/folders that begin with a period.  Since hidden folders and files start with a period, this removes hidden files/folders.
